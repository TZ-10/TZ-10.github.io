  <h1>About me:</h1>
  <img src="https://placehold.co/300x200?text=I+don't+want+to+show+my+face+:]">

  <p>My name is Tod-Erdene, but people call me Tod (with one “d”). I am a freshman majoring in data science
    <br><br>


I was born in Erdenet, Mongolia. It is a small city North of the capital, Ulaanbaatar. It is famous for its copper and molybdenum open-pit mine. I lived in Erdenet until I was around 2, when my family and I moved to Vancouver, Canada. We returned to my hometown when I was around age 7, which is where I stayed until I graduated high school.

My interests include playing video games such as Elden Ring, Overwatch 2, and Terraria being my all-time favorites.

My hobbies are going to the gym every now and then because I realized in my junior year how important my health is. Additionally, I enjoy spending time with my friends a lot, as they help me learn how to socialize with more people.
<br><br>



My favorite shows and movies are JOJO’s Bizarre Adventure, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Princess Mononoke, and The Lego Movie.
<br><br>



I am a boring person, but there are a few interesting facts about me, such as I used to have extremely long hair that fell down past my chest. I did cut it 2 days before I came here, though. Moreover, I have an extreme sweet tooth. I used to drink soda and sugar wafers almost every day for the better part of 4 years. However, I am actively trying to reduce my sugar consumption. I also have OCD, which forces me to count in my head obsessively daily. I usually count from 1 to 13 repeatedly throughout my day, so I may zone out sometimes.

    Below, I have linked the websites I use the most. Out of these, I use Spotify the most because I love music and listen to it daily.</p>
